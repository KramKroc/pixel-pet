# Interactive Pixel Pet

![](cover.png)

Make your very own digital space pixel pet with your Raspberry Pi and Sense HAT. Using sensors and output devices are a great way to make your computer programs more interactive. The Raspberry Pi Sense HAT contains a whole set of sensors that can be used to detect movement, which will be used in this activity to take a digital pet for a walk.
